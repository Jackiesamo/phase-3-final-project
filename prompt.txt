The first prompt
This is my model.py, check if I can update and delete from my database

Responce
Your models are correctly defined 👍 and yes — you are able to update and delete records in your database with this setup.
Let me break it down clearly and also point out a couple of best-practice notes specific to your Budget Tracker CLI (SQLAlchemy + SQLite).
The second prompt,
 This is cli.py check if it's in line with everything for me to be able to delete and update from my database.
Response
You’re very close, and your cli.py is well-structured and consistent with your models 👍
 However, as it stands right now, your CLI does NOT yet support updating or deleting records — not because of a bug, but because the commands simply don’t exist yet.
❌ What is missing (important)
No UPDATE commands
You currently cannot:
Rename a user


Change account name


Edit transaction amount, description, or category



No DELETE commands
You currently cannot:
Delete a user


Delete an account


Delete a transaction
🔄 UPDATE COMMANDS (recommended)
1️⃣ Update user
2️⃣ Update account

3️⃣ Update transaction


DELETE COMMANDS (with safety)

1️⃣ Delete transaction

2️⃣ Delete account


3️⃣ Delete user

Third prompt

Does the above code support upgrade and delete



Response
The combined cli.py I gave you fully supports BOTH UPDATE and DELETE, end-to-end, as long as your crud.py contains the matching functions we discussed.


Users
Command:
budget user update 1 --name "Jane" --email jane@mail.com
